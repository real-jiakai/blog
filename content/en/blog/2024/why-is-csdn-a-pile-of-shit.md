## Update (2024.09.16)

This morning browsing V2EX, I saw someone post—[CSDN has no bottom line, secretly setting my articles to VIP-only without my knowledge](https://www.v2ex.com/t/1073201). Combined with CSDN users' descriptions, this VIP-only thing apparently started in April 2024. Disgrace of domestic platforms, absolutely no bottom line.

In my original article I held back criticism, saying writing blogs on CSDN doesn't make you a clown—that's not wrong, but better to leave early.

## Background Story

In college, during the winter break after taking Data Structures in sophomore fall, I started using CSDN to record my solutions to data structure problems. That was probably my first time writing on the internet. First time using Markdown syntax for writing—the process was easy and enjoyable.

Later in sophomore spring, CSDN became my learning notes publishing platform. After each class, I'd make time to organize the lesson's key points in CSDN's Markdown editor. Computer Organization and Database courses were walked through this way.

Using blog posts to review course points after class was really nice. I remember learning SQL—I'd write and test SQL statements in SQL Server's editor, then copy them to CSDN editor, wrap them in Markdown code blocks, add corresponding comments, and instantly felt I understood deeply.

When teachers assigned exercises or experiments, I'd complete them immediately and share to CSDN right away. For exercises, I'd write explanations for every problem—explanations from searches, textbook knowledge, or my own understanding.

My sharing was gradually discovered by classmates in my class and even grade. After all, articles on CSDN rank high in Baidu and other search engines—just search keywords and you can locate precisely.

First time hearing I was noticed by others was from a classmate in the neighboring dorm. During a casual chat, he said he'd been checking my CSDN blog recently and followed me. Hearing my blog was followed and my sharing helped others, I felt excited and happy.

Gradually I found even the entire grade knew my blog. My study hall buddy said his dormmates all knew my blog. Watching my CSDN follower count keep climbing, and recognizing some followers' avatars matching my QQ friends list, or identifying who followed from nicknames, I was quite happy. Meanwhile, I realized my sharing needed to be careful and thorough—couldn't disappoint classmates' expectations.

The attention gave me more learning motivation. That period was definitely the proudest time of my college career.

In junior fall, I moved my Operating Systems and Computer Networks notes to my self-built Hexo blog. More or less some classmates from the grade continued following through the CSDN blog link I promoted.

Later during exam prep, I destroyed the Hexo blog and moved all text to Yuque knowledge base. Before destroying, I specifically saved it in the Internet Archive, but unfortunately the saved page couldn't display completely.

With time passing and AI rising, these exercise summaries' view counts have plateaued.

I haven't received like notifications on Yuque for a long time. After all, once you have the most powerful AI tools, just ask AI for thoughtful explanations—no longer need human explanations.

After moving Hexo blog content to Yuque, I deactivated that CSDN account. To my surprise, the original articles were still there—the so-called deactivation just set the account as "deactivated."

That's when I realized the importance of self-built blogs. Content written on platforms, besides being reviewed, is also owned by the platform. The platform promotes you, gives you traffic, your content feeds the platform.

Seeing articles still there, I wasn't strongly upset. I was actually thankful CSDN didn't delete my articles—after all, 162 articles suddenly gone without backup would make me regret being too impulsive years later.

## Criticizing CSDN

Recently preparing for the teaching certification IT exam [originally thought I registered for 3 subjects, but when printing the admission ticket the day before, found I only registered for one IT subject—I was stupid crying, knowledge memorized for subjects 1 and 2 can only be stored for next year's spring exam]. Late August/early September, doing some database knowledge problems—candidate keys, normal forms—I wanted to see my old study notes. So I opened CSDN, searched keywords, came to the deactivated blog homepage, but found many articles marked "VIP only."

I internally despised CSDN then but didn't take rights protection action.

This afternoon reviewing IT exam wrong answers, seeing candidate key and normal form related problems, immediately remembered CSDN charging for my articles. This time I didn't hesitate—directly scanned with WeChat to register a new CSDN account, transferred to human service. After communication, customer service removed all "VIP only" labels, and I said nothing more.

The GitCode incident in the first half of the year already dropped my impression of CSDN to rock bottom. This "VIP only" thing further refreshed my understanding.

CSDN platform's actions are a pile of shit! But writing blogs on CSDN doesn't mean you're a clown—as long as you persist, you can still improve yourself.
