OpenAI officially launched the GPT Store yesterday.

Along with the GPT Store, they also launched a new paid plan, ChatGPT Team.

Last night, Zhiliao, author of the ChatGPT-related project Pandora, launched a service that can help upgrade ChatGPT accounts to Plus for free. [via](https://ai-20240110.fakeopen.com/team)

Enter your ChatGPT account email, then click the invitation link to accept joining the workspace in your email, and your account automatically becomes a ChatGPT Team account. [Recommend using an alt account to try this; exploiting loopholes has risks. Using your main account could result in regrettable bans.]

The principle is shown below. Sacrificing the few for the many—using disposable accounts to upgrade to Team plan, nesting invitations to benefit everyone.

This blog post records my experience accepting Zhiliao's invitation to upgrade a ChatGPT alt to a ChatGPT Team account.

So far, the Team plan highlights compared to Plus:

- Increased conversation count, from Plus's 40 per 3 hours to 100 per 3 hours.

- Content won't be used by OpenAI for model training, while Plus accounts can opt out of having their conversations used for OpenAI model training.

Notes:

- Accepting invitation to join Team plan keeps the original personal account option alongside the workspace. Both workspace and original personal space can use ChatGPT-4.

- Higher conversation limits only apply in the workspace. Switching back to original personal account reduces conversation limit to 40 per 3 hours.

- Workspace and personal account conversation limits are calculated separately. When personal account's 40 per 3 hours is used up, workspace's 100 per 3 hours can continue being used.

After invitees join the workspace, they can continue inviting members to join.

The ChatGPT account that accepted the invitation link yesterday, when logged in today, showed the workspace was deactivated, but personal account ChatGPT-4 still works.

The ChatGPT account that accepted the invitation link today had its workspace deactivated around noon as well. Only ChatGPT-4 remains usable, but I estimate this bug fix is coming soon.

This loophole will eventually be patched. The main goal was just to try out the Team plan.

As of around noon on January 12, 2024 (before workspace deactivation), this workspace had nearly 10,000 members, with nearly 50,000 accounts waiting to accept invitations. I estimate this method will be blocked by OpenAI this afternoon at the earliest, and corresponding accounts may be banned for suspected abuse violating OpenAI policies.

If OpenAI doesn't modify their billing policy, we might truly enter a GPT communist era in the future—everyone crowdfunding a month of Team plan with disposable accounts, then infinitely nesting invitations.
