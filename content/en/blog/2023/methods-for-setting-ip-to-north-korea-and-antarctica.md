## Update (2025.11.1)

Recently while browsing NodeSeek posts, I saw some vendors selling North Korea IPv6 exit.

## Update (2025.6.1, 2025.7.7)

Yesterday I saw a post on L site—[How to Get Special IPs?](https://linux.do/t/topic/689703)

At the time, I saw screenshots of North Korea nodes from proxy services in the comments section, so I privately messaged that user.

Meanwhile, I searched for "North Korea IP" on Bilibili and actually found a corresponding "resurrection" North Korea IP video. Those interested in this can look into it further.

On July 1st, someone messaged me saying Douyin doesn't recognize North Korea IPs obtained this way, but Bilibili does.

![User's message](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/07/07/6S3hXFDoqw7bQPN.webp)

Tonight I watched another video from that Bilibili blogger about getting North Korea IPs. The basic principle seems to be using tunnelbroker combined with Fiddler packet capture to change the country code to KP. I haven't done it myself, and o3's explanation may not be accurate, but the general idea is conveyed.

The blogger discussing North Korea IPs updated another related video on July 3rd this year. Looking through the comments, there are still comments from North Korea locations, so it seems this method for getting North Korea IPs can still be used to show off on Bilibili.

## Update (2025.1.12)

Last month, North Korea IPs officially became history. Currently, getting North Korea IPs via Cloudflare Warp on the market has disappeared.

Some users identified the Russian vendor P Telecom selling North Korea machines as a scam vendor.

Getting Antarctica IPs via Cloudflare Warp has recently also had location issues, but I don't know the specific details.

These two region IPs are just for fun - in the end, they're really useless.

## Update (2024.8.27)

Not recommended to self-build. If self-building, don't purchase WARP products from wap.ac and ByteVirt anymore [both vendors have discontinued their WARP series products and can no longer be purchased]. Official announcements show WARP location issues cannot be resolved.

Friends who want to use North Korea or Antarctica IPs with global proxy to show off on Chinese websites can consider the proxy service I recommended before—[FacMaTa](https://amz.fmta.boo/register?code=PYcvODEE)

![FacMata announcement](https://cdn.sa.net/2024/08/27/ScoO6ZpT1gUtsD8.webp)

## Update (2024.2.14)

Vendor ByteVirt launched North Korea and Antarctica rare region NAT WARP VPS on their first anniversary (Valentine's Day 2024), at $2.14/year. They might restock later. Self-builders can follow this vendor.

## Update (2024.1.22 && 2024.2.21)

**2024.2.21**

wap.ac launched WARP VPS for sale on February 21, 2024, with options for Antarctica and North Korea.

**2024.1.22**

A while ago, another cheap vendor selling VPS with WARP exit to North Korea appeared. Overall, if using the self-building method, choosing wapac's North Korea VPS is currently the cheapest option; if using proxy services, FacMata is currently the cheapest solution.

## Update (2023 Second Half)

Found another new vendor selling North Korea and Antarctica IPv6 NAT in the self-build section.

- [MisakaF](https://www.misakaf.net/index.php?rp=/store/north-korea)

Since Chinese social platforms launched IP location display in the first half of last year, you can often see rare IP locations online.

Creative users can make IP locations display as North Korea and Antarctica.

This article lists some methods I personally know for setting IP location to North Korea and Antarctica.

## 1. Proxy Services

- [Top-tier proxy service TAG](https://tagss09.pro/#/auth/j6c8uF3k)

![TAG Antarctica node](https://vip2.loli.net/2023/08/17/8b1DX7fiN2CKsJP.webp)

![TAG North Korea node](https://vip2.loli.net/2023/08/17/fkIun2Q7SetJ4Cw.webp)

TAG's TG channel announcement shows they have North Korea and Antarctica nodes.

- [FacMata Proxy](https://amz.fmta.boo/register?code=PYcvODEE)

Compared to TAG, this service is cheaper.

![FacMata packages](https://vip2.loli.net/2023/08/17/LV5lNoi8FxqHdJT.webp)

Explore other services on your own.

Select North Korea or Antarctica nodes, enable global mode, and you can show off in Bilibili or Zhihu comment sections.

## 2. Self-Build

Purchase [GlobalVM](https://globalvm.top) products - Asia WARP NAT selecting North Korea region, Antarctica WARP NAT, use X-UI panel to build nodes.

For setup tutorials and key points, see YouTube Buliang Lin and this blog post—[GlobalVM North Korea IP NAT VPS Simple Review and Usage Tutorial](https://ccckfg.top/archives/768)

![GlobalVM products](https://vip2.loli.net/2023/08/17/5JArdO47L1glyTu.webp)

After setup, select North Korea or Antarctica nodes, enable global mode, and you can show off in Bilibili or Zhihu comment sections.

## 3. VPN Services

- HMA VPN (North Korea node)
- Windscribe VPN (Antarctica node)

VPN services are not recommended - not secure.
