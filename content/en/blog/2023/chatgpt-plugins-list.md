## Update

Plugin updates paused.

ChatGPT's plugin feature rolled out to me on April 28th of the previous month (2023.4.28).

At that time, there were only about two pages of plugins in the plugin store - around 10 or so.

After more than a month of updates and iterations, the plugin store has ballooned to nearly 250 plugins (as of 2023.6.3).

Moreover, new plugins are being added every day.

I roughly estimate that at least 1/4 of Plus users will be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the plugin store.

ChatGPT's numerous plugins are like apps in an app store - dazzling and hard to know where to start.

Therefore, I personally believe it's essential to regularly organize newly launched plugins. This way you can keep up with OpenAI's latest application developments, and these apps might improve your work efficiency.

Take a plugin that amazed me recently as an example. This plugin is called Bohita. It generates clothing based on your prompt, and if you like the design, you can place an order directly on the corresponding page. The merchant will produce the clothing and ship it to your home.

I was amazed. This plugin is incredibly innovative. It lets users become the true masters of their own clothing, designing their ideal outfits and connecting with merchants - this business model is worth learning from.

Although this plugin's design capabilities still need improvement, or rather the users' prompt-writing abilities need improvement, I believe over time this plugin will introduce more user-friendly prompt GUIs or predefined prompt options, and AI's ability to create clothing from prompts will greatly improve. At that point, this plugin will definitely be a hit.

Of course, the above is just my speculation, but looking at the AI wave trend that started in 2022, my speculation might actually become reality in the future.
