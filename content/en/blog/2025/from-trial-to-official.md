## Heart Belongs to 'Ling'

At 9:56 PM on November 17, 2025, I handed 52 Manta roses to Lingling. Then the street lights in the park witnessed our kiss. From that moment, we officially became a couple—I have a girlfriend now.

Though I didn't announce on WeChat Moments or QQ Zone, doesn't mean I don't value it. My thoughts are recorded on my various sites. Blog posts don't have to all be AI reviews or technical articles. Sometimes updating recent personal news is also a good choice. So I'm writing this article to record this beautiful moment in life.

25 years of life. Had chances to get into relationships before, but more or less delayed by bad timing. As age grows, I occasionally feel lonely. Having no desires is impossible—I yearn for love.

Below is the journey from Xiaohongshu buddy to boyfriend-girlfriend with Lingling.

Yes, 1 year ago I harshly criticized finding buddies on Xiaohongshu. See the end of this article. But there are indeed many real people there. Other dating apps all fall short somewhat.

Story began late September 2025. Maybe I was horny or sexually repressed. Near National Day, I had Gemini 2.5 Pro write a Xiaohongshu post looking for opposite-sex buddy to hang out. Bold title with authentic text feel.

![Having Gemini 2.5 Pro write Xiaohongshu post looking for opposite-sex buddy](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/10/02/8nkUevtO2CT3oa5.webp)

Lingling messaged me then. After initial chat, she probably felt we had many common topics, so she proactively asked to add my WeChat.

![Lingling wanted to add my WeChat](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/10/02/sZhXncJfQj7Gxla.webp)

I later confessed my post was a bit inappropriate. She comforted me saying her purpose for messaging wasn't pure either.

First time hanging out was September 29, 2025. We rode the Ferris wheel at Nanning South Lake Park together.

![Rode Nanning South Lake Park Ferris wheel with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/HVt47yPv6r8X3Zk.webp)

"On the Ferris wheel, memories spin through the past." This is a lyric from Wang Junkai's "Missing You on the Ferris Wheel." Our conversation started because she posted something about Wang Junkai. I'm also familiar with the TFBOYS trio. So chatting led to choosing to take her on the Ferris wheel—nicely echoing this song.

She's a pediatric nurse, same age as me, also born in 2000, 4 months older. Work is busy—can't guarantee holidays off.

Her initial impression: mature feminine charm, confident smiling at my phone camera. I took many photos of her.

After the Ferris wheel, we didn't walk around South Lake Park. Instead found a stone bench near Jiuqu Bridge, sat down to talk. Been in Nanning over 2 years with many feelings—like previous thesis pressure, etc. Appreciating rare flamingos, feeling lake breezes, embracing nature through conversation.

Then we had buffet at Sugelido. After, browsed small goods market at Chaoyang Square, then took subway back together.

![Had buffet at Sugelido with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/p5YdoGqnExF8l3S.webp)

She doesn't share rent—rents a room alone for independent living. Her place is near Qingchuan Station—next stop after Minzu University Station. Generally when we meet up, we gather at Qingchuan Station.

That was our first meeting. On the way back to dorm that night, I couldn't help but admire myself. So bold—actually daring to meet an online stranger. Is this still the insecure, introverted me?

Actually most Xiaohongshu buddy hangouts don't continue after the first time. After all both have ulterior motives—looks, personality, etc. can all cause contact to fade.

But Lingling and I didn't stop contacting each other. On October 7, 2025, end of National Day holiday, we hung out again. This time we went to a cat cafe. Wore wristbands and brought cat wands to feed cute kitties.

![Went to cat cafe with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/3QFWk27GeCKBgf4.webp)

After the cat cafe we browsed Nongyuan Road night market. As someone from Jiangsu, this was my first time at a night market. During first year grad school when dorm went hiking at Qingxiu Mountain, I was too tired halfway and left early. Roommates later went to this night market. This time made up for that regret. Attracted by the night market's worldly atmosphere. Night market was no longer distant text in essay exam questions—concretely presented before me.

Lingling's outfit made my heart flutter. Bun hairstyle with glasses—really wanted her to be my girlfriend.

![Lingling's outfit made my heart flutter](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/aXs3jbC2hgUS5Yf.webp)

Third hangout was October 11, 2025—Nanning Fantawild. My first time there. Previously saw Nanning Fantawild's Halloween theme online. Roommates probably haven't been—daily routine too busy to go out and relax.

After riding Polar Express, got scared by weightlessness. Experienced many more attractions—won't list all. At night watched "Zhong Kui Marries Off His Sister" stage play.

![Watched "Zhong Kui Marries Off His Sister" stage play at Fantawild](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/3Fv5jE8a4CgsJzi.webp)

Then Lingling took me on the pirate ship. She tricked me saying this ride wasn't as scary as Polar Express. So I got on with her. But once it started, I was shocked by the pirate ship's swing amplitude. Again like Polar Express, kept screaming to relieve my fear. Meanwhile Lingling next to me was calm as a rock, not a peep.
After the ride my face went pale again.

Fourth hangout was October 19, 2025—we went to KTV together. Lingling's opening song was Karen Mok's "So Many People in This World."

![Went to KTV with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/4sAXcYWeCOopFfL.webp)

Lingling queued a bunch of songs but didn't sing herself. Kept checking pediatric nurse group messages. I sang most of the songs.

At night we ate snail noodles together. Every time after snail noodles I order Wanglaoji herbal tea—otherwise stomach gets bloated. Snail noodles don't necessarily contain snails—just snail-based broth. Been in Nanning so long, only tried snail noodles in senior year. Didn't dare eat before. The fried tofu skin, long beans, sour bamboo shoots, etc. taste great.

![Ate snail noodles with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/gyqva4Q9sCFVzNG.webp)

We browsed Tingzi Dock together. Played racing games with Lingling in the arcade inside. Lingling's skills are amazing. Not just this time—many subsequent times playing racing together she always finished first.

![Went to Tingzi Dock with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/vpK4Qk6Nc3Ohw2I.webp)

Then accompanied Lingling browsing clothing shops. Every time tests my patience. First time browsing clothing shops was after cat cafe at Nongyuan Road night market.

![Accompanied Lingling browsing clothing shops](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/KdEZR9wLem1qrJB.webp)

Accompanying Lingling shopping is never boring. This little smarty—trying this shop's hairpins, that shop's hats—her experimenting fills our outings with fun.

Up to today, we've had at least 5+ badminton sessions. My school has courts. After her shift she brings badminton gear to school gate. I use my face for gate access.

![Regularly play badminton with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/Br278owhRTKVlua.webp)

She wins almost every time. Her smashes and side-to-side pulls I really can't defend. Usually I'm picking up shuttlecocks. Lingling says she likes playing with me because she can return my shots. Playing with me the newbie is satisfying. Before playing with local badminton friends, she was the one getting crushed.

Almost every badminton session I buy her dessert or milk tea. She also brings me snacks, pastries, fruits, etc.

I don't treat her as outsider—told her many secrets. She doesn't treat me as outsider either—even shared menstrual cycle stuff.

![Lingling shared menstrual cycle with me](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/RLMXQZS8cnU3W2b.webp)

Late October those days, from between the lines, I sensed Lingling might like me too. So one night I impulsively confessed. She neither rejected nor accepted, but said we can continue hanging out. Thought I was honest and sincere. Lingling's reply perfectly demonstrated her high EQ.

![Lingling responded to my impulsive confession with high EQ](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/dl1RCjKaIcAQz8m.webp)

Thinking about that experience still scares me. Thought I was sounding the victory charge—turned out to be trapped in "I thought" delusion. I was the clown.

After that experience, my thought: maintaining more-than-friends-less-than-lovers status is also nice. Restraining my feelings for Lingling.

One day she got off work after 7 PM. After playing badminton 8-9 PM with me, she drove me to eat beef offal.

![Lingling took me to eat beef offal after badminton](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/kXxiKzu1rjolCqy.webp)

Fifth hangout was October 31, 2025. She used my student 69% Haidilao discount.

Haidilao service is really good—treats customers like gods. Perfect for birthdays—can order birthday celebration performance. My first time at Haidilao. I'm a country bumpkin. Previously roommate birthdays usually chose buffet.

![Ate Haidilao with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/Im6Kq3F8kvQ7BUp.webp)

To wait for Haidilao's free manicure service, continued shopping with Lingling. This time Lingling's outfit also matched my aesthetics.

![To wait for Haidilao's free manicure service, continued shopping with Lingling.](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/brKChqlIt82waZ3.webp)

November 2, 2025—browsed night market next to Agricultural Vocational University. Below shows us eating oden together. "That year I kept my hands crossed without touching chopsticks, just to wait for you to take a photo."

![Ate oden with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/gn4LHbV8NkmDwGj.webp)

November 4, 2025—second visit to Nongyuan Road night market. Ate duck feet pot there. Lingling enthusiastically picked duck feet for me. I was too embarrassed to refuse. But overall this duck feet pot was too spicy for my taste. Even fresh vegetables like cabbage had to go in the spicy oil—hard for me to accept.

![Ate duck feet pot with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/TEAdganJ5GcxQe8.webp)

At night browsed Hongdou Binjiang Park. Adjacent to Yong River. At night many anglers by the river—my dad would definitely love this fishing spot.

![At night browsed Hongdou Binjiang Park with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/lxZNYUf6jGrIBT1.webp)

November 5, 2025—she came to my school library to study together.

![Lingling came to my school library to study together](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/duMA7tIxviDlo9B.webp)

At night we ate at Yonghe Soybean Milk. Finally found a brand in Guangxi I'd seen in Jiangsu.

![At night ate Yonghe Soybean Milk with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/RgTCH1Wz2xXNomA.webp)

Lingling gave me a Stitch plushie that night. When missing Lingling, I'll hug Stitch to ease the longing.

![Lingling gave me a Stitch plushie that night](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/xf4sZHoth6MYTpy.webp)

November 6, 2025—after her shift the hospital had monthly meeting. Meeting ended past 9 PM. I rode a shared e-bike to meet her then we ate snail noodles.

![Ate snail noodles with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/jPhgQJtA37Ciq9U.webp)

Then ate street food: wontons and BBQ. Good thing I bought wontons—Lingling's BBQ was all burnt and blackened. Without washing in wonton soup, BBQ was coated in black char.

![Ate street food with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/3c8GmrRNdLgzHxU.webp)

November 9, 2025—ate Vietnamese chicken pho at Chaoyang Square together. Tasted great.

![Ate Vietnamese chicken pho at Chaoyang Square with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/ZgaX4RdhmxCpQin.webp)

Browsed Sanjie Lianxiang. Listened to Nanning's JJ Lin impersonator. Lingling used my phone to record a clip and posted on Douyin. Next day she asked me to like it. Lingling doesn't use Bilibili—her main platform is Douyin. After following each other, we share interesting videos occasionally.

![Listened to Nanning's JJ Lin impersonator with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/zqQfUt41ZkexOuc.webp)

Then played DIY bead puzzles together. Also tests patience. First time playing was slow—started 8:30 PM, finished 10:30 PM.

![Our bead puzzle results](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/lpPwkdM6L7JWbsB.webp)

November 10, 2025—ate "Bangyang" healthy meal together. Nanning doesn't have "Laoxiangji"—only similar "Bangyang" restaurant.

![Ate "Bangyang" healthy meal with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/LegDqN5SOM1pus6.webp)

After eating went to console gaming cafe to play games. Both of us are newbies—couldn't figure out the game controllers. So we found a "Kung Fu Panda 3" movie on the big screen's cloud drive to watch.

When the movie started, we turned off room lights. 18th floor, self-service console cafe with just me and Lingling. Alone together as man and woman—can't help but have thoughts.

Lingling then asked me to warm her hands. Her hands were indeed cold. My hands are like a furnace. When Lingling grabbed my hands, I was excited and nervous—hands got even warmer. Lingling leaned on my shoulder. My two hands tightly held Lingling's two hands.

![I warmed Lingling's hands](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/4DPy3ZMfzqnXAs9.webp)

During the movie Lingling closed her eyes to rest—maybe sleepy. I was energized from body contact with Lingling. So exciting!

After the movie, Lingling softly said: "Hold me!" Woc, did I hear right? Lingling put her thigh on my thigh. One arm around Lingling, snuggling together. So happy!!!

Back at dorm that night lying in bed replaying scenes from past hours. Heart felt warm.

After the first experience, subsequent outings got even more unrestrained. I dropped my guard. Lingling was also proactive. Holding hands, hugging became normal. Lingling's hair fragrance is unforgettable.

November 14, 2025—we browsed flower and bird market together. Appreciated plants, animals, stones, etc.

![Browsed flower and bird market with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/DY8KyfscaPTkQ9U.webp)

Then browsed Shishan Park. Came once during Qingming Festival first half of year. Back then this park gave me a gloomy impression—morning full of elderly. This time with Lingling, stayed 2-3 hours. Found this park also nice—many spots worth exploring.

![Browsed Shishan Park with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/9d6SUntkwBVjiaZ.webp)

At night we ate at Green Tea Restaurant. This time Lingling chose to follow my lead—ate Jiangsu-Zhejiang cuisine.

![Ate at Green Tea Restaurant with Lingling](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/JhtNnWATXOygfG8.webp)

November 16, 2025—second visit to Hongdou Binjiang Park.

![Second visit to Hongdou Binjiang Park](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/edbXJxKnLQMjPBF.webp)

By the river gave Lingling a Titanic-style hug from behind. That night stayed by the river less than 2 hours—Lingling got sleepy. I jokingly said: "Then let's go sleep together?" Lingling readily agreed. But she drove her scooter not toward a hotel, but dropped me at school gate. On the way asked: "In what capacity do we get a room?" I was stumped—after all I'm a newbie.

That night on the way back to school she was cold to me. I thought she was mad at me. Next morning messaged her wanting to understand.

![Asked why Lingling ignored me last night](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/HgU6NMoGLvCn2It.webp)

She later asked: Did I want to be with her? Trial hand-holding hugging period over—want long-term, need to make it official!

![Lingling's follow-up and my reply](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/28jc5apN3UxduCw.webp)

I also expressed my thoughts. Definitely want to, but with precedent, didn't dare speak up again. Later she expressed anxiety.

Then with Gemini's guidance, I suddenly understood: She seems to like me too. Otherwise why would she allow hand-holding, hugging? Even getting anxious not receiving my definite reply?

![Gemini's caring guidance](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/AHynNfQMgBc59U7.webp)

Sure enough, this was the moment to sound the victory charge.

![Lingling expressed wanting confession ceremony](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/o9iSYFgV1CtRs7X.webp)

Last night third visit to Hongdou Binjiang Park. Gave her roses and confessed.

![Confessing to Lingling with roses](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/KVXyIoch7WgTEdj.webp)

Me: "Lingling, be my girlfriend?"

Lingling: "Let me think about it! Sure!"

Actually just going through motions. When Lingling anxiously waited for my definite reply, I knew it was 100% success.

![Lingling is really good at kissing](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/aiO8ozIyCZun356.webp)

Lingling is really good at kissing. At first I only knew how to close my eyes and purse my lips.

![By the river holding Lingling, Lingling pressed the shutter](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/qrAzjtQ5okVKa8u.webp)

Late night returning to dorm, roommate asked: "Where'd you go?" I replied: "Not telling you." Previously roommate guessed I was on dates—he guessed right.

I'm a focused person. Don't date just to play around. Last night also told Lingling: No unsolvable misunderstandings between couples. Mutual understanding, mutual support, running toward each other, meeting at the summit! Don't want to break up!

Love can't be sweet all the way. Will definitely mix with sourness and bitterness, just like life! Hope to unlock more colors of love with Lingling in the future.

![Love palette](https://cdn.sa.net/2025/11/18/8ctQk59wx3oN6AI.webp)

Many more stories ahead for us to paint on the love palette. Our story is to be continued!

## Epilogue

Love needs meeting the right person. The older you get, the more you realize a girl being considerate and understanding matters more than looks. Of course if excellent in both, definitely a rare find.
Don't be influenced by internet anti-marriage anti-childbirth views. When you meet the right person, why not bravely take that step? If you haven't met the right person, I absolutely support staying single.
Settling, sky-high bride prices, etc.—if encountering these situations, staying single is more comfortable!

Previously heard a roommate mention a negative example. Someone in his group (also my classmate) dated an undergrad junior during first year grad school. In that relationship, he became her "ATM"—she kept sending shopping links for him to pay. This is more like one-sided economic extraction. Very unhealthy model, not worth promoting. If in such a situation—"wake up from the dream early."

In contrast, I really appreciate how Lingling and I interact—a relationship built on equality and mutual respect. Most of our shared expenses we split AA. Unless I treat her or she treats me—generally we go back and forth. This kind of dating is more worth promoting.

During free time I secretly browse through previous photos. Can say without exaggeration—photos taken during these days with Lingling almost equals total photos from the past whole year. Anniversary: November 17, 2025. I'll commemorate regularly like family birthdays!
