# Introduction

The Today I Learned page shares what I learned today. I firmly believe that Learning In Public is the fastest way to learn. [via](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public)

This section is inspired by [Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til), [Simon Willison](https://til.simonwillison.net/), [Kevin Schaul](https://www.kschaul.com/til/), and [Now Page](https://nownownow.com/).

My TIL site publishes notes from two blogs, one decentralized social app, and three forums. TIL site: [https://til.gujiakai.top](https://til.gujiakai.top)

Two blogs: "Weekly Insights" updates occasionally, "Web Journal" aims for at least one post per month.

One decentralized social app, mainly for sharing thoughts.

Three private forums for sharing interesting things and recording knowledge learned. Posts are randomly rotated.
